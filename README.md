# Neo Geo MVS to CD Builders

These were originally created by iq_132. I asked if I could host these up on github to archive them and they agreed.

I am not the author, and at the time of writing this I know very little about these.

## Gururin

The Gururin Builder is located in the `gururin/` directory. It is simply iq_132's original zip file, unzipped.

Gururin has its own `read me.txt` file

`gururin/build.c` is the program that does the MVS->CD conversion

## Zupapa

The Zupapa Builder is located in the `zupapa/` directory. It is again iq_132's original zip file, unziped.
